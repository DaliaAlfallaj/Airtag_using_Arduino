# RFID_using_Arduino
# What is RFID technology and how does it work on my project?
An RFID or radio frequency identification system consists of two main components, a tag attached to the object to be identified, and a reader that reads the tag. When the tag is brought close to the reader,the reader generates an electromagnetic field, Also used LCD screen that will show massage  for states of the animal. And LED light. 

# The hardware that I used in the project?
-  RFID.
- Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) screen.
- light led.
